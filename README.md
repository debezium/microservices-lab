# microservices-lab

A lab focused on propagating data between microservices using Apache Kafka an Debezium, deployed to OpenShift via Strimzi.

Based on an earlier version run at Red Hat Summit 2018, this lab has been largely updated for Voxxed Microservices 2018 in Paris.
You can find the lab instructions [here](https://github.com/debezium/microservices-lab/tree/master/voxxed-microservices-2018).
